# xAPI-Workshop

Included in the Presentation folder are resources about:

* xAPI Overview
* DODI
* xAPI LRS Test Suite
* ADL LRS Overview
* Understanding an xAPI Statement
* xAPI Profiles

Included in the Tools folder is a basic statement generator and reporting app. The generator allows users to easily create xAPI statements from pre-populated drop down lists and abstracts the user from the more technical side. The reporting app looks for statements related to the [French Toast jQuery Mobile app](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-jqm).

Other ADL workshops that are geared more toward programmers and have programming exercises:

* [Intro to xAPI Data Visualization](https://github.com/adlnet/Intro-to-xAPI-Data-Visualization)
* [Intro to Developing Web Based xAPI Content](https://github.com/adlnet/Intro-to-Developing-Web-based-xAPI-Content)
* [Starting from SCORM A Developer's Guide](https://github.com/adlnet/Starting-from-SCORM-A-Developers-Guide)
